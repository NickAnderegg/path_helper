# path_helper

## WHAT?

A replacement for Apple's `/usr/libexec/path_helper`.

## WHAT DOES THAT DO?

It helps set the PATH environment variable, among other things.

## WHY REPLACE IT?

Because Apple's one loads the system libraries to the front, which almost certainly isn't what you want. Have a look:

    $ /usr/libexec/path_helper
    PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin
    <snip!>

## WHAT ELSE DOES IT DO?

I'm glad you asked. Apple has some good ideas (lots of them, actually) that developers overlook for whatever reason. One of them is the [*framework bundle structures*](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Concepts/FrameworkAnatomy.html), but more on that in a moment.

Apple's `path_helper` helps organise the `PATH` and `MANPATH` by listing things you want added to the path in text files in well known locations (e.g. /etc/paths and /etc/paths.d/*) it's easy to create a PATH that works for you. Where the Apple `path_helper` falls down is:

- It puts them in /etc meaning you need elevated permissions
- Being in /etc also makes them system wide
- It's only for `PATH` and `MANPATH` but development and administration often need new installs' headers and libraries accessible in the same way too
- The string it returns is designed to be `eval`'d. I know that `eval` isn't *always* evil but why not just return the `PATH` string and allow it to be set to a variable - maybe there's more to be added? Just a thought.

This library fixes those problems by extending that to:
  
    C_INCLUDE_PATH  
    DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH  
    DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH  

and of course, `PATH` and `MANPATH`.

## DO I NEED TO BE ON APPLE TO USE IT?

No, it should work on any unix-like system.

## Install ##

    gem install path_helper

or system wide:

    sudo gem install path_helper

Apple's path_helper is in `/usr/libexec`, this install won't touch it, you can always use it or return to it if you wish.

And checking its output:

    $ path_helper
    PATH="/opt/pkg/sbin:/opt/pkg/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/opt/ImageMagick/bin:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/opt/puppetlabs/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin"; export PATH;

## NOTE!

The script **doesn't set the PATH**, it *returns* a path, **you have to set the path** with it e.g. `PATH=$(/usr/local/libexec/path_helper.rb -p "")`. Call `/usr/local/libexec/path_helper -h` to see all the options.

### Another Note (slightly less important) ###

The output is just an example, I ran these at different times on different systems so they have slightly different output (aside from the aforementioned slight difference in API).

### ZSH/Bash

We also need to inform `ZSH` or `Bash` about the new `path_helper`. Using the shell version:

    if [ -x /usr/local/libexec/path_helper ]; then
      eval `/usr/local/libexec/path_helper`
    fi

The Ruby version:

    if [ -x /usr/local/libexec/path_helper.rb ]; then
      PATH=$(/usr/local/libexec/path_helper.rb -p)
    fi

The `Makefile` will print out what needs to go in, if you change any of the settings.

## Source Files ##

Apple has put paths in `/etc/paths` and further files are there for the user or apps to add under `/etc/paths.d/`. If you want to order them then prefixing a number works well, e.g.

    $ tree /etc/paths.d
    /etc/paths.d
    ├── 10-pkgsrc
    └── MacGPG2
    └── ImageMagick

The format of the file is simply a path per line, e.g.

    $ cat /etc/paths.d/10-pkgsrc
    /opt/pkg/bin
    /opt/pkg/sbin

    $ cat /etc/paths            
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/local/sbin
    /usr/bin
    /usr/sbin
    /bin
    /sbin

### Note: ###

The `/etc/paths` file in Apple isn't set out fully or in the order I'd want so I changed mine, you may want to do the same.


## Per user paths ##

This is the bit I like best.

There's not really any help made for paths that might be local to the user, like `~/.rubies` or something like that so I've added two places the Ruby script will check for further paths:

- `~/Library/Paths/paths.d` and `~/Library/Paths/paths`, and 
- `~/.config/paths.d/` and `~/.config/paths`

You can use the `--setup` to have the path_helper set up the directory layout and files, you just have to fill them!

The Ruby script will also allow use of the tilde `~` character in a path by replacing it with the `HOME` env variable. For example, if I install Haskell and want to put it in my path I can do the following.

### Way 1, Use the paths, Luke

    $ echo '~/Library/Haskell/bin' > ~/Library/Paths/paths

    $ tree ~/Library/Paths 
    /Users/iainb/Library/Paths
    ├── paths
    └── paths.d

    $ cat ~/Library/Paths/paths                          
    ~/Library/Haskell/bin

That puts `/Users/iainb/Library/Haskell/bin` at the front of my path and will only apply to my account's `PATH`.

### Way 2, paths.d/

    $ touch ~/Library/Paths/paths.d/60-Haskell

    $ tree ~/Library/Paths 
    /Users/iainb/Library/Paths
    ├── paths
    └── paths.d
        └── 60-Haskell


#### Why use the paths.d sub directory?

If I show you my actual set up it'll become clearer:

    $ tree ~/Library/Paths 
    /Users/iainb/Library/Paths
    ├── paths
    └── paths.d
        ├── 05-pkgsrc
        ├── 08-homebrew
        ├── 10-keybase
        ├── 30-oh-my-zshell
        ├── 50-ngrok
        ├── 55-Crystal-opt
        ├── 60-Crystal
        ├── 61-Opam
        ├── 62-Haskell
        ├── 63-Erlang
        ├── 63-Go
        ├── 64-Pyenv
        ├── 65-Rust
        └── 66-Antigen

Once you start installing various things it make sense to keep their paths in their own file, it's easier to organise (and remove).

## The order


    Library/Paths/paths.d ordered as the file system does
    Library/Paths/paths
    .config/paths.d (same again)
    .config/paths
    /etc/paths.d (same again)
    /etc/paths

## Why Library/Paths/paths and not Library/paths ?

Because this is such a useful pattern that I've extended it for headers and includes, read on!

## Man paths and DYLD and C_INCLUDE ##

### Manpaths

Apple has already dictated that `/etc/manpaths` and `/etc/manpaths.d/` are the default paths for setting `MANPATH`, so the same pattern has been followed for that as with `PATH`, so just add `~/Library/Paths/manpaths` or `~/.config/manpaths` along with the `manpaths.d` sub directory if you wish.

- `~/Library/Paths/manpaths.d/`
- `~/.config/manpaths`
- `~/Library/Paths/manpaths.d/`
- `~/.config/manpaths`
- `/etc/manpaths.d/`
- `/etc/manpaths`


### DYLD ###

Same goes for DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH (if using the Ruby script):

- `~/Library/Paths/dyld_library_paths.d/`
- `~/.config/dyld_library_paths`
- `~/Library/Paths/dyld_library_paths.d/`
- `~/.config/dyld_library_paths`
- `/etc/dyld_library_paths.d/`
- `/etc/dyld_library_paths`

and:

- `~/Library/Paths/dyld_framework_paths.d/`
- `~/.config/dyld_framework_paths` 
- `~/Library/Paths/dyld_framework_paths.d/`
- `~/.config/dyld_framework_paths` 
- `/etc/dyld_framework_paths.d/`
- `/etc/dyld_framework_paths`


### C_INCLUDE ###

Same again for `C_INCLUDE`:

- `~/Library/Paths/include_paths.d/`
- `~/Library/Paths/include_paths`
- `~/.config/include_paths.d/`
- `~/.config/include_paths`
- `/etc/include_paths.d/`
- `/etc/include_paths`

(and the `include_paths.d` sub dir too, for the last two if you wish).

## Setting your .zshenv or .bashenv

You may find it helpful to add this to your ~/.zshenv or ~/.bashenv etc:

    if [ -x /usr/local/libexec/path_helper ]; then
      PATH=$(/usr/local/libexec/path_helper -p "")
      DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH=$(/usr/local/libexec/path_helper --dyld-fram "")
      DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=$(/usr/local/libexec/path_helper --dyld-lib "")
      C_INCLUDE_PATH=$(/usr/local/libexec/path_helper -c "")
      MANPATH=$(/usr/local/libexec/path_helper -m "")
    fi


    export PATH
    export DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH
    export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH
    export C_INCLUDE_PATH
    export MANPATH

    If you expected items you'd inserted in the path manually to
    show up earlier then either clear the path before running this
    and reinsert or add paths via:
      (~/Library/Paths|~/config)/paths.d
      (~/Library/Paths|~/config)/paths/*)


    /opt/pkg/bin:/opt/pkg/sbin:/opt/pkg/gnu/bin:/Users/iainb/homebrew/bin:$HOME/gopath:$HOME/gopath/bin:/Users/iainb/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/fzf/bin:/Users/iainb/Applications/ngrok:/opt/crystal/bin:/opt/crystal/embedded/bin:/Users/iainb/Library/Frameworks/Crystal.framework/Versions/Current/bin:/Users/iainb/Library/Frameworks/Crystal.framework/Versions/Current/embedded/bin:/Users/iainb/Library/Frameworks/Opam.framework/Programs:/Users/iainb/Library/Haskell/bin:/Users/iainb/Library/Frameworks/Erlang.framework/Programs:/Users/iainb/go/bin:/Users/iainb/.pyenv/bin:/Users/iainb/.cargo/bin:/Users/iainb/bin:/opt/local/bin:/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/Commands:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin%  

Everything you need to know! Very useful for working out when other things are manipulating the path too.

## Development

I'm happy to hear from you, email me or open an issue. Pull requests are fine too, try to bring me a spec or an example if you want a feature or find a bug.

Sorry the current specs aren't in such good shape, I hope to improve that.
